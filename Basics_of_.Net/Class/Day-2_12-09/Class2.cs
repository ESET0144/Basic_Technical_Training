Design a console-based Book Shop Management System that allows a shopkeeper to manage a
book and sales for a single customer. The system should add new book by specifying the title,
author, price, and quantity. It should allow shopkeeper to sell book to a customer by entering the
book title, quantity and customer name ensuring that sales do not exceed available stock and
updating the inventory accordingly. The program should present a menu-driven interface with
input validation and continue to accept commands until the user chooses to exit. The system
manages only one customer during a session.
